    "description": "Built InfoQuest, an app that helps coworkers give compliments and collect digital cards. Made the backend with Kotlin, Spring Boot, and Spring Modulith, using PostgreSQL for the database. Created a mobile app that works on different phones using Kotlin Multiplatform and built a website with React. Added NFC features so users can interact by touching phones together and used AI to create card images. Worked in a team of 2 and learned from experienced developers. If you are a student reading this, I really recommend doing your internship at Info Support!",
